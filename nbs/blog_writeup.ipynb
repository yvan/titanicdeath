    "This is the writeup for <a href=\"http://titanicdeath.com\">titanicdeath.com</a>. Besides having a truly fantastic name, this little website I created tells you whether or not you would be likely to die on the titanic provided some small amount of personal information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question you are probably asking is: <b>why did i die?</b> or <b>why did i live?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest determining factor in whether you lived or died is your gender. <b>Females were much more likely to survive the sinking of the titanic than men.</b> If you have ever heard the phrase 'women and children first' you will have an intuitive understanding of why this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next bigest determinant of survival is what class you travelled in; <b> passengers in first class were more likely to survive</b>. This makes some sense; often times first class passengers receive benefits. One of the benefits on a sinking ship may have been easier access to lifeboats. Third class passengers were below deck and may not have had the means to escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age is another important factor, <b>the younger you are the more likely it is that you survived.</b> It seems young people and children had some level of priority on lifeboats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you were traveling alone or with others on the titanic helps to deterimine whether you passed away tragically or miraculously survived. This is why <a href=\"http://titanicdeath.com\">titanicdeath.com</a> asks if you are married or have siblings. <b>Travellers who were alone on the titanic or travelling with large numbers of relatives were more likely to have died</b>. Travellers who were alone may have had to wait or may not have had lower priority (compared with women and children) on lifeboats. Many large families were in third class where death rates were high.\n",
